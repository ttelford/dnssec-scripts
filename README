This is a simple script to simplify a basic amount of verification for the
DNSSEC root keys.

It requires:
	* wget
	* gpg
	* dig
	* dnssec-dsfromkey

This script does the following:
	* Downloads (using https) the following:
		* root-anchors.xml file from IANA.
		* The (detached) GPG signature for root-anchors.xml
	* Imports the icann PGP keychain (DNSSEC Manager <dnssec@iana.org>)
	* Verifies the GPG signature of root-anchors.xml
	
	* Obtains the GPG key via DNS using dig
	* Compares the key obtained via DNS with the key obtained with https.
	* Prints the results

At this time, there is no checking to see if the various tools actually exist;
therefore, it can easily fail to run properly.

This script has been tested on Linux
